# Daily-Planner

##Description
This project is the fifth challenge of a bootcamp where students had to develop a work day scheduler where they had to implement:
  * To create a daily planner where the current day is displayed when the user opens the page
  * Time blocks where the user can insert tasks for the day
  * Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
  * The tasks inserted by the user will be saved into the local storage
  * The saved tasks will persist afer the page is refreshed
  * After the submission of a task the task slot will be disabled
  * To insert a new task the user will have to eliminate the one submited before
  * This daily planner was developed with Third-Party API's such as:
    ** Jquery, Moment.js and Bootstrap
